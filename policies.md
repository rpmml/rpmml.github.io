<h1>Course Policies</h1>
<hr style="margin: 1em 0">

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>Final grades will be determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem Sets: <b>20%</b></li>
<li>Paper Presentations: <b>15%</b></li>
<li>Pre-class Paper Reviews: <b>15%</b></li>
<li>In-class Participation: <b>10%</b></li>
<li>Final Project: <b>40%</b></li>
</ul>

<h3>Late Submissions</h3>
<p>Assignments should be submitted by 11:59pm EST on their due date. Each student is given 6 late days that may be used towards any assignment except the last final project deadline.
Late days will be tracked by course staff.
After all late days are used, grading penalties are as follows: -10% for 1 day, -20% for 2 days, -30% for 3 or more days.
The last day to submit an assignment for credit is the final project due date.
</p>

<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>Some assignments are explicitly collaborative (e.g., final projects). For all other assignments, you may discuss with your peers, but keep those discussions at a high level of abstraction. Do not look closely at other people's code or writing before submitting your own. All code and writing that you submit should be produced by you. Under no circumstances should you copy code or writing.
If you are working towards a late submission after solutions have already been released, you should not discuss the assignment with anyone who has already submitted.
</p>

<h3>Language Model Policy</h3>
<p>You may use language models at your discretion, but use good judgment. Checking your grammar is a good idea; generating a full answer to a problem set question is a bad idea because it will hinder your learning (and the answer will likely be wrong).</p>
